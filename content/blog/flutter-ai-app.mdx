***Some of the best ready-made state-of-art models available on Firebase are:***

* Text Recognition and Face Detection

* Image Labeling

* Object Detection & Tracking

* Language Identification

* Smart Reply

* AutoML Model Interface

* Custom Model Interface

While using this method of integrating ML and AL to Flutter App, make sure your app is using Firebase or either you have a custom model that will be hosted on another server setup. Also, this method is suitable for models which expect regular updates but not so frequent.

### **2. Models as APIs**

It is one of the other popular methods of incorporating machine learning in apps, mostly when you are working with servers and web interfaces and expecting your model to update very frequently.

While using this method, developers wrap the model in API services and host it using web-based servers. Major developers reply on these popular platforms including AWS Lambda, Google App Engine, Heroku or Virtual Machine as it supports running the model and serving as a web-based service.

### **3. On-Device Model**

On-device models are effective methods, in case you want to perform high-speed inference directly on the devices of the users.

The primary way to use this model is to firstly create them as TensorFlow models. To export them as .tflite files, you can use the ML Kit plugin in your flutter app. Before shipping the file, you need to import the stored .tfilte file from the project repository and make it run for the interface.

To make it easier for you to understand, you can download the sample from the Flutter application using the Face Detection model readily available on Firebase and then use it as an on-device model.

This model is an ideal choice of integration when you want your app users to experience super-fast inference and not providing regular updates.
